        <h2>1. Javascript</h2>
        <p><span style="color: blue;"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"> JavaScript</a></span> is a high-level programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. It is used as a client-side programming language by 97.8 percent of all websites. JavaScript was originally used only to develop web browsers, but they are now used for server-side website deployments and non-web browser applications as well. <br><br>

          Javascript was created in 1995 and was initially known as LiveScript. However, Java was a very popular language at that time, so it was advertised as a “younger brother” of Java. As it evolved over time, JavaScript became a fully independent language. Nowadays, JavaScript is often confused with Java, and although there are some similarities between them, the two languages are distinct.<br><br>
          
          Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and is in high demand among various organizations. The average Java developer earns around $112,152 each year.   </p> <br><br>     
        </p>

         <h2>2. Python</h2>
          <p><span style="color: blue;"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "> Python</a></span> is one of the most popular programming languages today and is easy for beginners to learn because of its readability. It is a free, open-source programming language with extensive support modules and community development, easy integration with web services, user-friendly data structures, and GUI-based desktop applications. It is a popular programming language for machine learning and deep learning applications. <br><br>

            Python is used to develop 2D imaging and 3D animation packages like Blender, Inkscape, and Autodesk. It has also been used to create popular video games, including Civilization IV, Vegas Trike, and Toontown. Python is used for scientific and computational applications like FreeCAD and Abacus and by popular websites like YouTube, Quora, Pinterest, and Instagram. Python developers earn average annual salaries of about $109,092.<br><br>

            <h2>3. Go</h2>
            <p><span style="color: blue;"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)"> Go</a></span> was developed by Google in 2007 for APIs and web applications. Go has recently become one of the fastest-growing programming languages due to its simplicity, as well as its ability to handle multicore and networked systems and massive <br><br>

              Go, also known as Golang, was created to meet the needs of programmers working on large projects. It has gained popularity among many large IT companies thanks to its simple and modern structure and syntax familiarity. Companies using Go as their programming language include Google, Uber, Twitch, Dropbox, among many others. Go is also gaining in popularity among data scientists because of its agility and performance. </p> <br><br>

            <h2>4. Java</h2>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)"> Java</a> is one of the most popular programming languages used today. <br><br>

            Owned by Oracle Corporation, this general-purpose programming language with its object-oriented structure has become a standard for applications that can be used regardless of platform (e.g., Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.) because of its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capabilities. As a result, Java is recognized for its portability across platforms, from mainframe data centers to smartphones. Today there are more than 3 billion devices running applications built with Java. <br><br>
            
            Java is widely used in web and application development as well as big data. Java is also used on the backend of several popular websites, including Google, Amazon, Twitter, and YouTube. It is also extensively used in hundreds of applications. New Java frameworks like Spring, Struts, and Hibernate are also very popular. With millions of Java developers worldwide, there are hundreds of ways to learn Java. Also, Java programmers have an extensive online community and support each other to solve problems. <br><br>
            
            Java is a more complex language to learn, but experienced developers with Java coding skills are in high demand. The average Java developer earns around $109,225 each year. <br><br>
          </p> <br><br>

          <h2>5. Kotlin</h2>
          <p><a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin(programming_language)"> Kotlin</a> is a general-purpose programming language originally developed and unveiled as Project Kotlin by JetBrains in 2011. The first version was officially released in 2016. It is interoperable with Java and supports functional programming languages. <br><br>

            Kotlin is used extensively for Android apps, web application, desktop application, and server-side application development. Kotlin was built to be better than Java, and people who use this language are convinced. Most of the Google applications are based on Kotlin. Some companies using Kotlin as their programming language include Coursera, Pinterest, PostMates among many others. <br><br>
            
            Kotlin developers earn an average of $136,000 a year, with the potential to earn up to $171,500. </p> <br><br>

            <h2>6. PHP</h2>
            <p> <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP"> PHP</a>  is an open-source programming language created in 1990. Many web developers find it essential to learn PHP, as this language is used to build more than 80% of websites on the Internet, including notable sites like Facebook and Yahoo.<br><br>

              Programmers mainly use PHP mainly to write server-side scripts. But developers can also use this language to write command-line scripts, and programmers with high-level PHP coding skills can also use it to develop desktop applications.<br><br> 
              
              PHP is considered a relatively easy language to learn for beginning developers. PHP professionals have access to several dedicated online communities, making it easy to get support and answers to questions.<br><br>

              <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C#"> C#</a>,Developed by Microsoft, C# rose to fame in the 2000s for supporting the concepts of object-oriented programming. It is one of the most used programming languages for the .NET framework. Anders Hejlsberg, the creator of C#, says the language is more like C++ than Java. <br><br>

                C# is best suited for applications on Windows, Android, and iOS, as it takes the help of the integrated development environment product, Microsoft Visual C++. C# is used on the back end of several popular websites like Bing, Dell, Visual Studio, and MarketWatch. C# developers earn around $111,760 per year. </p><br><br>
